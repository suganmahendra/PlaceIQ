# 🔓 How to Open PlaceIQ to All Students (1 Minute)

You do **NOT** need to add every student's email manually.

Google restricts new apps to "Testing Mode" by default. You just need to flip the switch to "Production".

---

## 🟢 Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console
1. Open this link: [Google OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)
2. Make sure your project **"PlaceIQ"** is selected at the top.

---

## 🟢 Step 2: Click "PUBLISH APP"
1. Look for the **"Publishing status"** section (under the app name).
2. It currently says **"Testing"**.
3. Click the button that says **"PUBLISH APP"**.
4. A popup will ask you to confirm. Click **"Confirm"**.

---

## ✅ DONE!
The status will change to **"In production"**.

**What this means:**
*   **ANY** student or mentor can now sign in with their Google account.
*   You never need to add emails manually again.
*   Users might see a "Google hasn't verified this app" warning. This is normal. Tell them to click **"Advanced"** -> **"Go to PlaceIQ (unsafe)"** to continue.

## 📧 Note on Email/Password Signup
If you don't want to use Google right now, the **Email & Password** signup ALREADY works for everyone!
1. A student enters their email.
2. They get a verification link.
3. They click it and are logged in.
